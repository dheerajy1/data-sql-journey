Would you like to explore the journey of a data analyst and learn how a data analyst tells a story with data?

### **Introduction**

> As a data analyst, you are on a journey.

With data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business.

Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.

You need to be able to look at the data and facilitate trusted business decisions. Then, you need the ability to look at metrics and clearly understand the meaning behind those metrics.

Data analysis exists to help overcome these challenges and pain points, ultimately assisting businesses in finding insights and uncovering hidden value in troves of data through storytelling.

As you read on, you will learn how to use and apply analytical skills to go beyond a single report and help impact and influence your organization by telling stories with data and driving that data culture.

### **Overview of data analysis**

> Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information.

The data is then crafted into a story through reports for analysis to support the critical decision-making process.

While the process of data analysis focuses on the tasks of cleaning, modeling, and visualizing data, the concept of data analysis and its importance to business should not be understated. To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:

* Descriptive - key performance indicators (KPIs) - return on investment (ROI), organization's sales and financial data.
    
* Diagnostic - questions about why events happened
    
* Predictive - questions about what will happen in the future
    
* Prescriptive - questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target.
    
* Cognitive - a self-learning feedback loop.
    

> As the amount of data grows, so does the need for data analysts. A data analyst knows how to organize information and distill it into something relevant and comprehensible. A data analyst knows how to gather the right data and what to do with it, in other words, making sense of the data in your data overload.

### **Roles in data**

* Business analyst
    
* Data analyst
    
* Data engineer
    
* Data scientist
    
* Database administrator
    

### **Tasks of a data analyst**

* Data preparation - profiling, cleaning, and transforming your data to get it ready to model and visualize.
    
* Data modeling - determining how your tables are related to each other.
    
* visualization - report should tell a compelling story about that data.
    
* Analyze - find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights.
    
* Manage - management of Power BI
    

A data analyst uses appropriate visuals to help business decision makers gain deep and meaningful insights from data.

An optimized and tuned semantic model performs better and provides a better data analysis experience.

A key benefit of data analysis is the ability to gain valuable insights from a business's data assets to make timely and optimal business decisions.
