Would you like to explore the journey of a data analyst and learn how a data analyst tells a story with data?

### **Introduction**

> As a data analyst, you are on a journey.

With data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business.

Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.

You need to be able to look at the data and facilitate trusted business decisions. Then, you need the ability to look at metrics and clearly understand the meaning behind those metrics.

Data analysis exists to help overcome these challenges and pain points, ultimately assisting businesses in finding insights and uncovering hidden value in troves of data through storytelling.

As you read on, you will learn how to use and apply analytical skills to go beyond a single report and help impact and influence your organization by telling stories with data and driving that data culture.

### **Overview of data analysis**

> Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information.

The data is then crafted into a story through reports for analysis to support the critical decision-making process.

While the process of data analysis focuses on the tasks of cleaning, modeling, and visualizing data, the concept of data analysis and its importance to business should not be understated. To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:

* Descriptive - key performance indicators (KPIs) - return on investment (ROI), organization's sales and financial data.
    
* Diagnostic - questions about why events happened
    
* Predictive - questions about what will happen in the future
    
* Prescriptive - questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target.
    
* Cognitive - a self-learning feedback loop.
    

> As the amount of data grows, so does the need for data analysts. A data analyst knows how to organize information and distill it into something relevant and comprehensible. A data analyst knows how to gather the right data and what to do with it, in other words, making sense of the data in your data overload.

### **Roles in data**

* Business analyst
    
* Data analyst
    
* Data engineer
    
* Data scientist
    
* Database administrator
    

### **Tasks of a data analyst**

* Data preparation - profiling, cleaning, and transforming your data to get it ready to model and visualize.
    
* Data modeling - determining how your tables are related to each other.
    
* visualization - report should tell a compelling story about that data.
    
* Analyze - find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights.
    
* Manage - management of Power BI
    

## Answers:

A data analyst uses appropriate visuals to help business decision makers gain deep and meaningful insights from data.

An optimized and tuned semantic model performs better and provides a better data analysis experience.

A key benefit of data analysis is the ability to gain valuable insights from a business's data assets to make timely and optimal business decisions.

## **Learning objectives**

In this module, you'll:

* Learn about the roles in data.

| Module 2/17 | Get started building with Power BI |

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/achievements/get-started-power-bi.svg align="center")

## **Introduction**

**Microsoft Power BI** is a complete reporting solution that offers data preparation, data visualization, distribution, and management through development tools and an online platform.

Use Power BI to create visually stunning, interactive reports requiring complex data modeling & to serve as the analytics and decision engine.

## **Use Power BI**

Power BI Desktop - development tool available to data analysts and other report creators.  
Power BI service - allows you to organize, manage, and distribute your reports and other Power BI items, create high-level dashboards that drill down to reports.

The flow of Power BI is:

1. Connect to data with Power BI Desktop.
    
2. Transform in Power Query and model data with Power BI Desktop.
    
3. Create visualizations and reports with Power BI Desktop.
    
4. Publish report to Power BI service.
    
5. Distribute and manage reports in the Power BI service.
    

## **Building blocks of Power BI**

The building blocks of Power BI are **semantic models** and **visualizations**.

semantic model - consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships, and calculations.

## **Tour and use the Power BI service**

**Workspaces** are the foundation of the Power BI service.

Distribute content - Apps are the ideal sharing solution within any organization.

Refresh a semantic model - configure scheduled refreshes of your semantic models in the Power BI service.

## Answers:

The Power BI service lets you view and interact with reports and dashboards, but doesn't let you shape data.  
Without a semantic model, you can't create visualizations, and reports are made up of visualizations.

An app is a collection of ready-made visuals, pre-arranged in dashboards and reports. You can get apps that connect to many online services from the AppSource.

## **Summary**

Microsoft Power BI offers a complete data analytics solution that includes data preparation, visualization, and distribution.

**Semantic models** and **visualizations** are the building blocks of Power BI.

| --- | --- |
| Module 3/17 | **Get data in Power BI** |

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/achievements/get-data.svg align="center")

You'll learn how to retrieve data from a variety of data sources, including Microsoft Excel, relational databases, and NoSQL data stores.

You'll also learn how to improve performance while retrieving data.

# **Introduction**

create a suite of reports that are dependent on data in several different locations.

This module will focus on the first step of getting the data from the different data sources and importing it into Power BI by using Power Query.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-data/media/1-data-source-scenario-c.png#lightbox align="center")

## **Get data from files**

A flat file is a type of file that has only one data table and every row of data is in the same structure.

The file doesn't contain hierarchies. Likely, you're familiar with the most common types of flat files, which are comma-separated values (.csv) files, delimited text (.txt) files, and fixed width files.

Another type of file would be the output files from different applications, like Microsoft Excel workbooks (.xlsx).

Change the source file - Data source settings.

## **Get data from relational data sources**

SQL Server.

Change data source settings - Power BI /Home tab, select Transform data, and then select the Data source settings option.

Write an SQL statement - SQL is beneficial because it allows you to load only the required set of data by specifying exact columns and rows in your SQL statement and then importing them into your semantic model. You can also join different tables, run specific calculations, create logical statements, and filter data in your SQL query.

It's a best practice to avoid doing this directly in Power BI. Instead, consider writing a query like this in a view.

A view is an object in a relational database, similar to a table. Views have rows and columns, and can contain almost every operator in the SQL language.

If Power BI uses a view, when it retrieves data, it participates in query folding, a feature of Power Query. Query folding will be explained later, but in short, Power Query will optimize data retrieval according to how the data is being used later.

## **Create dynamic reports with parameters**

Creating dynamic reports allows you to give users more power over the data that is displayed in your reports; they can change the data source and filter the data by themselves.

Power Query Editor / Home tab, select Manage parameters &gt; New parameter.

## **Create dynamic reports for multiple values**

To accommodate multiple values at a time, you first need to create a Microsoft Excel worksheet that has a table consisting of one column that contains the list of values.

## **Get data from a NoSQL database**

A NoSQL database (also referred to as non-SQL, not only SQL or *non-relational*) is a flexible type of database that doesn't use tables to store data.

If you're working with data stored in JSON format, it's often necessary to extract and normalize the data first. This is because JSON data is often stored in a nested or unstructured format, which makes it difficult to analyze or report on directly.

## **Get data from online services**

To support their daily operations, organizations frequently use a range of software applications, such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Dynamics 365, Google Analytics and so on. These applications produce their own data. Power BI can combine the data from multiple applications to produce more meaningful insights and reports.

## **Select a storage mode**

## **Learning objectives**

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* Identify and connect to a data source
    
* Get data from a relational database, like Microsoft SQL Server
    
* Get data from a file, like Microsoft Excel
    
* Get data from applications
    
* Get data from Azure Analysis Services
    
* Select a storage mode
    
* Fix performance issues
