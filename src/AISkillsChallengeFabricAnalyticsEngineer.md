In this article, I am going to log my learnings completed as part of the AI Skills Challenge: Fabric Analytics Engineer.

# Foreword:

> The entire content is owned by Microsoft, and I am logging for practice and it is for educational purposes only.

# **I. Introduction to end-to-end analytics using Microsoft Fabric**

Discover how Microsoft Fabric can meet your enterprise's analytics needs in one platform. Learn about Microsoft Fabric, how it works, and identify how you can use it for your analytics needs.

## **Introduction**

Fabric provides a set of integrated services that enable you to ingest, store, process, and analyze data in a single environment.

Fabric includes the following services:

* Data engineering
    
* Data integration
    
* Data warehousing
    
* Real-time analytics
    
* Data science
    
* Business intelligence
    

## **Explore end-to-end analytics with Microsoft Fabric**

Scalable analytics can be complex, fragmented, and expensive.

Fabric is a unified *software-as-a-service* (SaaS) offering, with all your data stored in a single open format in OneLake. OneLake is accessible by all of the analytics engines in the platform.

### **Explore OneLake**

OneCopy is a key component of OneLake that allows you to read data from a single copy, without moving or duplicating data.

Think of it like OneDrive for data;

OneLake is built on top of *Azure Data Lake Storage* (ADLS) and data can be stored in any format, including Delta, Parquet, CSV, JSON, and more.

### **Explore Fabric's experiences**

Fabric's experiences include:

* **Synapse Data Engineering**: data engineering with a Spark platform for data transformation at scale.
    
* **Synapse Data Warehouse**: data warehousing with industry-leading SQL performance and scale to support data use.
    
* **Synapse Data Science**: data science with Azure Machine Learning and Spark for model training and execution tracking in a scalable environment.
    
* **Synapse Real-Time Analytics**: real-time analytics to query and analyze large volumes of data in real-time.
    
* **Data Factory**: data integration combining Power Query with the scale of Azure Data Factory to move and transform data.
    
* **Power BI**: business intelligence for translating data to decisions.  
    

### **Explore security and governance**

In the admin center you can manage groups and permissions, configure data sources and gateways, and monitor usage and performance.  

## **Data teams and Microsoft Fabric**

## **Enable and use Microsoft Fabric**

Fabric is built on Power BI and Azure Data Lake Storage, and includes capabilities from Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Machine Learning.

## **Knowledge Check**

Which of the following is a key benefit of using Microsoft Fabric in data projects?

Fabric's OneLake provides a single, integrated environment for data professionals and the business to collaborate on data projects.

What is the default storage format for Fabric's OneLake?

The default storage format for OneLake is Delta Parquet, an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes.

Which of the following Fabric workloads is used to move and transform data?

The Data Factory workload combines Power Query with the scale of Azure Data Factory to move and transform data.

# **Summary**

Data professionals are increasingly expected to be able to work with data at scale, and to be able to do so in a way that is secure, compliant, and cost-effective.

At the same time, the business wants to use that data more effectively and quickly to make better decisions.

Microsoft Fabric is a collection of tools and services that enables organizations to do just that. In this module, you learned about Fabric's OneLake storage, what workloads that are included in Fabric, and how to enable and use Fabric in your organization.
